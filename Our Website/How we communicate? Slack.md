## Why Slack, Why not Messenger, why not WhatsApp?
Communication is important to every organization, especially in an increasingly remote world. While communicating with other colleagues, it is important the channels of communication are well organized, easy to find, and easily understood. Slack is one of the few platforms that gives you the ability to manage all communication channels in a company. All departments in a company or organization can use this one platform as their channel for communication. These features are what make Slack a step up from other websites.
